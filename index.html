            <p>Created by Marvel Comic writers Stan Lee and Steve Ditko, Spider-Man first graced the pages of American
                comic books in August 1962, making his appearance in Amazing Fantasy #15. During the age where teenage
                and child comic book characters were relegated to sidekick or other supporting roles, Spider-Man was
                the first of his kind, dealing with everyday struggles adolescent readers could relate to. (Well, minus
                the whole spider bite from a radioactive spider turning him into a superhero thing.)</p>
